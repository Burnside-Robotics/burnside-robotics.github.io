        <p>
          Robotics is a club where students can invent, learn and develop ideas
          with others in a fun, safe environment. In robotics, over the course
          of a year, teams of students will develop a robot which will be
          competed against other robots in games. This robot will be programmed
          and built with Vex parts like aluminium parts or Lego-like parts, this
          teaches students how to use tools and build to make a functional
          technological system. Once the robot is completed, the teams will then
          travel to Auckland or Palmerston North to compete in the annual Vex
          Nationals. The Nationals is a time where students will see if their
          robot fails or succeeds. Students will learn different ways of solving
          problems and will meet friends all around the country and others like
          themselves.

        <h1 class="ArticleHeading">WHAT WE OFFER</h1>
        <p>
          At robotics, we offer Vex VRC and Vex IQ. Vex VRC is the category in
          which robots are built out of metal parts and compete with other
          robots. Vex IQ is the category in which robots are built out of
          Lego-like pieces and play with other robots to attain the highest
          score. The teams with the highest scores go to Worlds and in 2020, BHS
          X got the opportunity to go to Worlds. The Robotics club allows for
          any student who is willing to learn to be able to develop various
          skills in STEM. Skills such as problem solving, programming, building
          and working in a team. This helps students to think outside the box
          and will help them in the future. Joining robotics will not only help
          students develop these important skills and attain knowledge but it
          will also help them create friends and try new things in this safe
          environment.

        <p>
          Vex Robotics is the fast growing robotics competition in the world. It
          contains three divisions: Vex EDR, Vex IQ, and Vex U. Burnside
          Robotics compete in the Vex EDR division which is for Intermediate and
          High School students. This year we are planning to compete in Vex IQ
          as we have enough teams to be able to explore that field. Vex has an
          annual game for each of its division and these games are introduced in
          April and are competed in February. This allows competitors to always
          be kept on their toes and helps them to think of solutions in
          different ways. This means students need to design, build and program
          a robot for each new challenge.

            Vex EDR
          </h1>
          <p>
            Vex EDR is a robotics system designed for years 9-13. It mostly uses
            metal construction parts with electric motors. You can also use
            pneumatics within your robot but that also has a limit so teams
            canâ€™t be overpowered. It is incredibly versatile. For the
            competition there are limits to how big the robot can be and how
            many motors and other components we use. This makes the challenge a
            bit harder as we have to think of solutions within these limits.

            Vex IQ is also a robotics system designed for intermediate schools.
            It uses mostly lego like parts and electric motors. Vex IQ robots
            are significantly smaller and...

          Building robots is expensive. As the number of students interested
          grow, and robot parts wear away, we need funding for more, but with
          help from our sponsors we can continue to do what we do best. We would
          like to give a special thanks to the Tait Foundation for being out
          best ongoing sponsor. If you would be interested in becoming a
          sponsor, please email or phone the contact details at the bottom of
          this page. Sponsorship can include, logos on team clothing, robots,
          and on banners.
