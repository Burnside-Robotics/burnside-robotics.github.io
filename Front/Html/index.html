        <p>
          Burnside Robotics Club is a team of students attending Burnside High
          School that love to build robots. We have competed in multiple
          national Vex Robotics competitions and have qualified for the world
          competition. Our members are enthusiastic in the areas of STEM
          (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths) and enjoy competing with
          their creations.

        <p>
          Vex Robotics is the fast growing robotics competition in the world. It
          contains three divisions: Vex EDR, Vex IQ, and Vex U. Burnside
          Robotics compete in the Vex EDR division which is for Intermediate and
          High School students. This year we are planning to compete in Vex IQ
          as we have enough teams to be able to explore that field. Vex has an
          annual game for each of its division and these games are introduced in
          April and are competed in February. This allows competitors to always
          be kept on their toes and helps them to think of solutions in
          different ways. This means students need to design, build and program
          a robot for each new challenge.

            Vex EDR
          </h1>
          <p>
            Vex EDR is a robotics system designed for years 9-13. It mostly uses
            metal construction parts with electric motors. You can also use
            pneumatics within your robot but that also has a limit so teams
            canâ€™t be overpowered. It is incredibly versatile. For the
            competition there are limits to how big the robot can be and how
            many motors and other components we use. This makes the challenge a
            bit harder as we have to think of solutions within these limits.

            Vex IQ is also a robotics system designed for intermediate schools.
            It uses mostly lego like parts and electric motors. Vex IQ robots
            are significantly smaller and...
