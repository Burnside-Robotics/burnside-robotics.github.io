        <p>
          Robotics is a club where students can invent, learn and develop ideas
          with others in a fun, safe environment. In robotics, over the course
          of a year, teams of students will develop a robot which will be
          competed against other robots in games. This robot will be programmed
          and built with Vex parts like aluminium parts or Lego-like parts, this
          teaches students how to use tools and build to make a functional
          technological system. Once the robot is completed, the teams will then
          travel to Auckland or Palmerston North to compete in the annual Vex
          Nationals. The Nationals is a time where students will see if their
          robot fails or succeeds. Students will learn different ways of solving
          problems and will meet friends all around the country and others like
          themselves. They will also learn vital STEM skills such as building,
          programming and teamwork skills which can help them in STEM fields and
          in everyday life.

        <h1 class="ArticleHeading">WHAT WE OFFER</h1>
        <p>
          At robotics, we offer Vex VRC and Vex IQ. Vex VRC is the category in
          which robots are built out of metal parts and compete with other
          robots. Vex IQ is the category in which robots are built out of
          Lego-like pieces and play alongside other robots to attain the highest
          score. The teams with the highest scores go to Worlds and in 2020, BHS
          X got the opportunity to go to Worlds. The Robotics club allows for
          any student who is willing to learn to be able to develop various
          skills in STEM. Skills such as problem solving, programming, building
          and working in a team. This helps students to think outside the box
          and will help them in the future. Joining robotics will not only help
          students develop these important skills and attain knowledge but it
          will also help them create friends and try new things in this safe
          environment.

        <h1 class="ArticleHeading">WHAT IS VEX?</h1>
        <p>
          Vex robotics is the fastest growing robotics competition in the world.
          It contains three divisions: Vex VRC, Vex IQ, and Vex U. Burnside
          Robotics compete in the Vex VRC division which is for intermediate and
          high school students. This year we are planning to compete in Vex IQ
          (which also has the same divisions) as this year we have enough teams
          to be able to explore that field.
          <br />
          <br />
          Vex VRC has an annual game for each of its divisions and these games
          are introduced in April and are completed in NZ in February. Vex IQ
          also has an annual game for each of its divisions except these games
          are introduced in April and are completed in NZ in December. This
          allows competitors to always be kept on their toes and helps them to
          think of solutions in different ways. This means students need to
          design, build and program a robot for each new challenge every year.

          </h1>
          <p>
            Vex VRC is a robotics system designed for years 9-13. It uses mostly
            metal construction parts with electric motors. You can also use
            Pneumatics within your robot but that also has a limit so teams
            canâ€™t be overpowered. It is incredibly versatile. For the
            competition there are limits to how big the robot can be and how
            many motors and other components we use. This makes the challenge a
            bit more harder as we have to think of solutions within these
            limits.

          <h1 class="VexInfoHeading" style="color: #0080ff;">Vex IQ</h1>
          <p style=>
            Vex IQ is also a robotics system designed for years 4-10. It uses
            mostly lego like parts and electric motors. Vex IQ robots are
            significantly smaller but still carry out the same principals. For
            the competition they still have a size limit, motor limit and the
            type of components used are also limited. These restrictions are
            what pushes students to think outside the box. Although using lego
            this means the structure is more fragile, students have to think of
            ways to make it work and that is what makes this challenge a
            challenge.

          Building robots is expensive. As the number of students interested
          grow, and robot parts wear away, we need funding for more, but with
          help from our sponsors we can continue to do what we do best. We would
          like to give a special thanks to the Tait Foundation for being out
          best ongoing sponsor. If you would be interested in becoming a
          sponsor, please email or phone the contact details at the bottom of
          this page. Sponsorship can include, logos on team clothing, robots,
          and on banners.
