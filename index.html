            <h1>WHAT IS VEX?</h1>
            <p>Vex Robotics is the fast growing robotics competition in the world. It contains three divisions: Vex EDR, Vex IQ, and Vex U. Burnside Robotics compete in the Vex EDR division which is for Intermediate and High School students. This year we
                are planning to compete in Vex IQ as we have enough teams to be able to explore that field. Vex has an annual game for each of its division and these games are introduced in April and are competed in February. This allows competitors to
                always be kept on their toes and helps them to think of solutions in different ways. This means students need to design, build and program a robot for each new challenge.

                <p class="VexInfoParagraph">Vex EDR is a robotics system designed for years 9-13. It mostly uses metal construction parts with electric motors. You can also use pneumatics within your robot but that also has a limit so teams canâ€™t be overpowered.
                    <br>
                    <br> It is incredibly versatile. For the competition there are limits to how big the robot can be and how many motors and other components we use. This makes the challenge a bit harder as we have to think of solutions within these
                    limits.

            <h1>Sponsors</h1>
            <p>Building robots is expensive. As the number of students interested grow, and robot parts wear away, we need funding for more, but with help from our sponsors we can continue to do what we do best. We would like to give a special thanks to
                the Tait Foundation for being out best ongoing sponsor. If you would be interested in becoming a sponsor, please email or phone the contact details at the bottom of this page. Sponsorship can include, logos on team clothing, robots, and
                on banners.</p>
